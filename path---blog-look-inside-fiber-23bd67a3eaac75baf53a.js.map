There were also a few topics that lacked \\\"press coverage\\\".</p>\\n<p>Thus, down the rabbit hole I went!</p>\\n<p>Fiber is not the most straightforward piece of software, both conceptually and\\ncode-wise, so it should be approached in a structured way.\\nThis post will go outside-in - starting from calling the <code>render</code>\\nfunction in client JS and changing state of a component, down to\\ndescribing the steps taken by Fiber to do all the work.\\nAt a few points along the way you will be given a choice to go further down or\\nreturn to the tip and track your way back to the same point from a different\\norigin.</p>\\n<p>If you feel like it, you can grab the Fiber codebase from Github and track your\\nway through the post in the code, starting <a href=\\\"https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/src/renderers/dom/fiber/ReactDOMFiberEntry.js\\\">here</a>.</p>\\n<p>React source code is sprinkled with a lot of error handling, dev logging and\\nperformance measurement calls. I'm going to skip those and focus on the main\\nlogic for the sake of clarity.</p>\\n<p>Another point to note is that currently Fiber code is coupled to the DOM\\nrenderer in a few places, because things are still developing, as I understand it.\\nI'll try to avoid referring to it, but you can assume that \\\"the renderer\\\" means\\n\\\"the DOM renderer\\\" in this post.</p>\\n<p><a id=\\\"org882dfad\\\"></a></p>\\n<h2>The first render: scratching the surface</h2>\\n<p>So you have your HTML skeleton in place, relevant JS is loaded, and you hit that\\nfirst <code>render</code> call. Because the page and the fiber tree is empty (there is no <code>root</code>), Fiber knows\\nthat it doesn't have to worry about asynchronous processing, since nothing\\nshould be happening outside of React itself.\\nSo it creates a fiber instance that will represent your container as the root of\\nthe fiber tree.\\nThen it tells the <code>Scheduler</code> that what happens next should be considered as <code>unbatchedUpdates</code>.\\nThe update in question is telling the <code>Reconciler</code> to <code>updateContainer</code>, where\\nthe <code>container</code> is the root fiber that has just been created.</p>\\n<p>\\\"Updating the container\\\" at this point means the following:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>\\n<p>**Set the root fiber <code>context</code>. **\\nYeah, the thing that the docs tell you to avoid using.\\nOverall I haven't found anything relevant to this post there.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p><strong>Push an update into the update queue of the root fiber.</strong>\\nThe \\\"bulk\\\" of the update is the <code>state</code>. At that moment in the <code>Scheduler</code>\\ncontext it is called <code>nextState</code>, because this state is what will be\\nhappening next. In the context of the update queue it is called\\n<code>partialState</code>, because it will be merged with the <code>prevState</code>.\\nIt is also the state you use in your React components.</p>\\n<p>React's composability is nicely visible here - if you squint just a little,\\nrendering your application is not much more than a glorified <code>setState</code> call.</p>\\n<p>The update has a set priority level - remember that the <code>Scheduler</code> has been\\ntold to do <code>unbatchedUpdates</code>? Because of that the priority level is set to\\n<code>SynchronousPriority</code>. It means that this update must be done ASAP, without\\nworrying about blocking the UI thread. The priority is being used to\\ndetermine where in the fiber's update queue this particular update should go.\\nIn this case the queue is empty, so it will be the head. Even if the queue wasn't\\nempty though, it's ordered by descending priority - the update would still go\\nto the front (given there are no prior <code>SynchronousPriority</code> updates there already).</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p><strong>Tell the <code>Scheduler</code> to schedule the update work to be done.</strong>\\nThis is where the ball gets rolling.\\nWhen the <code>Scheduler</code> is told to schedule an update, it looks at the\\nnodes in the fiber tree, traversing it using the <code>return</code> property of each fiber.</p>\\n<p>This property is pointing to a node which should be worked on next in case a\\nwork phase gets interrupted (more on that later). For the sake of simplicity\\nyou can assume it's the parent fiber.</p>\\n<p>So the <code>Scheduler</code> goes up the tree starting from the node that the update\\nshould be scheduled for, bumping up priorities where needed along the way,\\nuntil it reaches the root. It can see that it's at the root, because there is\\nno <code>return</code> node from it.\\nIn the current case (initial render), the update has been scheduled for the\\nroot node, so we're already there.</p>\\n<p>Upon reaching the root, the <code>Scheduler</code> puts it in a <code>scheduledRoot</code> list\\n(more about this later, that's how it later finds new work to do) and finally\\nschedules the work according to given priority. In our example it's\\n<code>SynchronousPriority</code>, so it jumps to the \\\"doing work\\\" phase immediately.</p>\\n<p>That's all there is to <code>render</code>. The \\\"doing work\\\" phase is generic across all\\nthe flows, so it's described in it's own chapter. You can go there now if you\\nfeel the flow. Alternatively, you can read how Fiber arrives at this phase\\nwhen you call <code>setState</code> if you need a bit more context.</p>\\n</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p><a id=\\\"orgc07b371\\\"></a></p>\\n<h2>Changing state: it's not too exotic</h2>\\n<p>Each React component instance has an <code>updater</code>.\\nThe <code>updater</code> is an injected dependency and mediates the communication between\\nthe components and the React core.</p>\\n<p>With Fiber, the <code>updater</code> has 4 responsibilities:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Find a fiber instance in the tree that corresponds to this component.</li>\\n<li>Ask the <code>Scheduler</code> about the priority level for this fiber.</li>\\n<li>Push updates to the fiber's update queue.</li>\\n<li>Schedule update work to be done with the determined priority level.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>Sounds familiar? It should, because that's almost exactly the same thing that\\nhappens on render.</p>\\n<p>You probably know that, but I should point out that there are two forms of arguments\\nit can be called with:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><code>setState({ ... }, [callback])</code></li>\\n<li><code>setState((prevState, props) => ({ ... }), [callback])</code></li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>It's not crucial at this point, but good for you to keep in mind as the\\nfirst form will eventually become deprecated. More on that later.</p>\\n<p>Ok, so you call <code>setState((prevState, props) => ({ ... }), [callback])</code>\\nin your component. It tells its <code>updater</code> to enqueue a <code>setState</code>.</p>\\n<p>Let's go through the 4 responsibilities.</p>\\n<h3>1. Find a fiber instance in the tree that corresponds to this component.</h3>\\n<p>   It's just getting a thing from the <code>ReactInstanceMap</code> - which is just that, a\\nmap, nothing fancy. One perhaps slightly interesting thing about it is that\\nit maps from public facing instances to internal methods. Example:\\n</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><code><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">get</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">function</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>key<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">return</span> key<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>_reactInternalInstance<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<h3>2. Ask the <code>Scheduler</code> about the priority level for this fiber.</h3>\\n<p>   There is a <code>Scheduler</code> method called <code>getPriorityContext</code> that provides a\\nsuitable priority level for a fiber update. For all intents and purposes,\\nthe priority level for a <code>setState</code> will be <code>LowPriority</code>. Refer to the\\nglossary to see how that priority level stacks up against the others.</p>\\n<p>   <em>There are 2 edge cases to this, but you shouldn't concern yourself with\\nthem too much.\\nIf you're studying for a test and must know, they are:\\nexplicitly passing a <code>useSyncScheduling: true</code> parameter to the context getting\\nfunction, which will result in <code>SynchronousPriority</code>; and having\\n<code>priorityContext</code> of <code>SynchronousPriority</code> during the work phase or a\\n<code>batchedUpdates</code> callback - which will result in <code>TaskPriority</code>.</em></p>\\n<h3>3. Push updates to the fiber's update queue.</h3>\\n<p>   This logic is pretty much the same as in the initial render case. The only\\ndifferences are that:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><code>setState</code> is not a top-level update, so the code doesn't check if the\\nupdate is a top-level unmount.</li>\\n<li>the priority level is lower (<code>LowPriority</code>).</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>   The new update is being inserted to the fiber's update queue according to the\\npriority level - so most likely it will get added to the end of the queue.</p>\\n<h3>4. Schedule update work to be done with the determined priority level.</h3>\\n<p>   As I've mentioned before, this logic is generic across all the flows - so\\nnothing changes here in terms of walking the tree. To reiterate, Fiber walks\\nthe <code>return</code> nodes starting from the node for which the update is being\\nscheduled until it reaches the root node (whose <code>return</code> is <code>null</code>). Along\\nthe way, it bumps up the <code>pendingWorkPriority</code> of each node to the currently\\ngiven level if it's lower. In this case the level is <code>LowPriority</code> so it's\\nnot likely for too many changes in the <code>pendingWorkPriority</code> values to occur.</p>\\n<p>   After reaching the root, Fiber schedules the update work - due to\\n<code>LowPriority</code> it's scheduled with <code>requestIdleCallback</code>.\\nThat brings us to the end of the <code>setState</code> flow.\\nThe logic exits and when time comes, the work phase begins.</p>\\n<p><a id=\\\"org13b502a\\\"></a></p>\\n<h2>Doing the work: show me the money</h2>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Ahh, you're here. Good. We've got a problem. A big one.</p>\\n<p>– <cite>The Overseer, Vault 13</cite></p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>Well, not really. ;) Or not so much anymore at least, having asynchronous work\\nscheduling on our side!\\nThat said though, you might want to take a breath/coffee/stretch before this one - this is the\\nmeat and potatoes of Fiber and might get a bit dense.</p>\\n<p>The actual execution of the scheduled work is split up in 2 main phases:\\nrender/reconciliation and commit.</p>\\n<p>Let's jump in.</p>\\n<p><a id=\\\"orga27f81c\\\"></a></p>\\n<h3>Render / reconciliation.</h3>\\n<p>This phase happens within the fiber tree and thus can be interrupted.\\nNo DOM interaction takes place here yet. This is one of the big wins and differentiating factors from the traditional\\nrenderer.\\nAs the code can rely on the <code>deadline</code> value provided by\\n<code>requestIdleCallback</code>, it can split the work in time to avoid busting UI frames.</p>\\n<p>During this phase, Fiber aggregates the updates building up a second,\\n<code>workInProgress</code> copy of the fiber tree, which is the <code>alternate</code> of the\\n<code>current</code> tree. The <code>current</code> tree is the one that is flushed to the DOM at\\nthe given moment.</p>\\n<p>Each of the flows described previously stopped at the phase where the work\\nwas to be executed immediately (for <code>SynchronousPriority</code>) or scheduled with\\nan async callback request function.</p>\\n<p>The function that is being called or scheduled at that point is <code>performWork</code>.\\nIts purpose is to catch and handle errors happening during the reconciliation of the\\nupdates and building up the tree. It does it by running a <code>while</code> loop that\\nbails out in case of errors. Within this loop, the <code>workLoop</code> function\\nis being called.</p>\\n<p>We're here. The core of the nuclear reactor.</p>\\n<p><code>workLoop</code> finds a fiber to work on, which consists of looking through the\\n<code>scheduledRoot</code> list (that's where the top-level updates go, remember?) for\\nthe highest priority root fiber.</p>\\n<p>Then, it checks whether a <code>deadline</code> exists and whether the current priority\\nof work is lower than <code>TaskPriority</code>, meaning that the execution of this work\\nmust obey the time limitations of the current frame.\\nIf there is no <code>deadline</code> or the priority is high enough then it runs a normal\\n<code>while</code> loop until it can find no more work to do.</p>\\n<p>If a <code>deadline</code> exists however (or the priority is low), then it runs a <code>while</code>\\nloop until there is work to be done and the <code>deadline</code> hasn't yet expired.\\nAs long as that conditions hold, in terms of Fiber <strong>we are in a deferred batch</strong>.\\n(again, any bells ringing? <code>batchedUpdates</code> way back when I was describing <code>render</code>?)\\n<span class=\\\"underline\\\">This is where the decision is being made to either carry on with processing the\\nfibers or to defer the processing to the next frame to avoid causing jank in the UI.</span></p>\\n<p>Here, the current unit of work is being <em>performed</em>.\\nPerforming the work is a process consisting of two stages: <code>begin</code> and <code>complete</code>.</p>\\n<h4>Stage 1: beginning the work</h4>\\n<p>When the work is \\\"being begun\\\", the code checks whether the priority of\\nthe work-in-progress fiber is high enough to be processed given the priority at\\nwhich work is currently supposed to be processed and bails out if it's not.</p>\\n<p>Beginning the work encompasses a lot of things, which I think are out of scope\\nsince we're deep enough and they would take <strong>a lot</strong> of space to describe.\\nIn short, what happens here depends on the work-in-progress fiber type, and is\\nhandled by a big <code>switch</code> statement:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><code><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">switch</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>workInProgress<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>tag<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">case</span> IndeterminateComponent<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">return</span> <span class=\\\"token function\\\">mountIndeterminateComponent</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>\\n      current<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span>\\n      workInProgress<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span>\\n      priorityLevel<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">case</span> FunctionalComponent<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">return</span> <span class=\\\"token function\\\">updateFunctionalComponent</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>current<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> workInProgress<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">case</span> ClassComponent<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">return</span> <span class=\\\"token function\\\">updateClassComponent</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>current<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> workInProgress<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> priorityLevel<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">case</span> HostRoot<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">return</span> <span class=\\\"token function\\\">updateHostRoot</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>current<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> workInProgress<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> priorityLevel<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">case</span> HostComponent<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">return</span> <span class=\\\"token function\\\">updateHostComponent</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>current<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> workInProgress<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">case</span> HostText<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">return</span> <span class=\\\"token function\\\">updateHostText</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>current<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> workInProgress<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">case</span> CoroutineHandlerPhase<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token comment\\\">// This is a restart.

That's because the work-in-progress one just got flushed to the DOM, so\\nconceptually it became the <code>current</code>.</p>\\n<p>The second pass calls lifecycle hooks, <code>setState</code> callbacks, <code>ref</code> callbacks\\nand component-level error handling methods (new feature in Fiber!).</p>\\n<p>After the second pass (and some housekeeping), the priority level from before\\nthe commit ie restored from <code>previousPriorityContext</code>.</p>\\n<p><a id=\\\"org3c31b83\\\"></a></p>\\n<h2>That's all, folks!</h2>\\n<p>With sufficient squinting and skipping over ancillary details, we have drilled\\nthrough the main features of React Fiber, from the first client <code>render</code> call, down to\\nthe nitty-gritty of scheduling and splitting the work into phases.</p>\\n<p>If you didn't have the Fiber codebase handy while reading this, it might be\\ninteresting for you to go grab it and read through this post again - this time\\ntracking your steps through the code. You'll see that even though there is quite\\na few cogs in the machine of Fiber, it is way less complicated than you'd expect.</p>\\n<p>If you see any mistakes or omissions, feel free to point them out!\\nI'll amend the post.</p>\\n<p>I did my best to skip over aspects that were not key to the main responsibility\\nof Fiber.\\nBut a few of them are very interesting in themselves, or are used in an\\ninteresting way, for example:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Component-level error handling, error boundaries</li>\\n<li>The use of object pooling</li>\\n<li>Dependency injection</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>There might be another post coming, which will describe those things, so stay tuned!</p>\\n<p>And lastly, the obligatory wafting paragraph. It's good to <em>actually know</em> how\\nthe tools you use every day work. Of course it's not always possible or sensible\\nto look at everything - but the perspective, sense of confidence and\\nsatisfaction gained from this type of activity is significant.\\nYou have to read a lot to become a great writer. I think programmers are no\\ndifferent - and JavaScript fatigue, the state of Web development, Angular 4,\\nReact 16 or Webpack 3 should not serve as an excuse to neglect this practice.</p>\\n<p>As craftspeople, we need to study the tools we use and other people's\\ncraft we see around us to improve our own and perhaps eventually surpass it.</p>\\n<p><a

There were also a few topics that lacked \\\"press coverage\\\".</p>\\n<p>Thus, down the rabbit hole I went!</p>\\n<p>Fiber is not the most straightforward piece of software, both conceptually and\\ncode-wise, so it should be approached in a structured way.\\nThis post will go outside-in - starting from calling the <code>render</code>\\nfunction in client JS and changing state of a component, down to\\ndescribing the steps taken by Fiber to do all the work.\\nAt a few points along the way you will be given a choice to go further down or\\nreturn to the tip and track your way back to the same point from a different\\norigin.</p>\\n<p>If you feel like it, you can grab the Fiber codebase from Github and track your\\nway through the post in the code, starting <a href=\\\"https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/src/renderers/dom/fiber/ReactDOMFiberEntry.js\\\">here</a>.</p>\\n<p>React source code is sprinkled with a lot of error handling, dev logging and\\nperformance measurement calls. I'm going to skip those and focus on the main\\nlogic for the sake of clarity.</p>\\n<p>Another point to note is that currently Fiber code is coupled to the DOM\\nrenderer in a few places, because things are still developing, as I understand it.\\nI'll try to avoid referring to it, but you can assume that \\\"the renderer\\\" means\\n\\\"the DOM renderer\\\" in this post.</p>\\n<p><a id=\\\"org882dfad\\\"></a></p>\\n<h2>The first render: scratching the surface</h2>\\n<p>So you have your HTML skeleton in place, relevant JS is loaded, and you hit that\\nfirst <code>render</code> call. Because the page and the fiber tree is empty (there is no <code>root</code>), Fiber knows\\nthat it doesn't have to worry about asynchronous processing, since nothing\\nshould be happening outside of React itself.\\nSo it creates a fiber instance that will represent your container as the root of\\nthe fiber tree.\\nThen it tells the <code>Scheduler</code> that what happens next should be considered as <code>unbatchedUpdates</code>.\\nThe update in question is telling the <code>Reconciler</code> to <code>updateContainer</code>, where\\nthe <code>container</code> is the root fiber that has just been created.</p>\\n<p>\\\"Updating the container\\\" at this point means the following:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>\\n<p>**Set the root fiber <code>context</code>. **\\nYeah, the thing that the docs tell you to avoid using.\\nOverall I haven't found anything relevant to this post there.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p><strong>Push an update into the update queue of the root fiber.</strong>\\nThe \\\"bulk\\\" of the update is the <code>state</code>. At that moment in the <code>Scheduler</code>\\ncontext it is called <code>nextState</code>, because this state is what will be\\nhappening next. In the context of the update queue it is called\\n<code>partialState</code>, because it will be merged with the <code>prevState</code>.\\nIt is also the state you use in your React components.</p>\\n<p>React's composability is nicely visible here - if you squint just a little,\\nrendering your application is not much more than a glorified <code>setState</code> call.</p>\\n<p>The update has a set priority level - remember that the <code>Scheduler</code> has been\\ntold to do <code>unbatchedUpdates</code>? Because of that the priority level is set to\\n<code>SynchronousPriority</code>. It means that this update must be done ASAP, without\\nworrying about blocking the UI thread. The priority is being used to\\ndetermine where in the fiber's update queue this particular update should go.\\nIn this case the queue is empty, so it will be the head. Even if the queue wasn't\\nempty though, it's ordered by descending priority - the update would still go\\nto the front (given there are no prior <code>SynchronousPriority</code> updates there already).</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p><strong>Tell the <code>Scheduler</code> to schedule the update work to be done.</strong>\\nThis is where the ball gets rolling.\\nWhen the <code>Scheduler</code> is told to schedule an update, it looks at the\\nnodes in the fiber tree, traversing it using the <code>return</code> property of each fiber.</p>\\n<p>This property is pointing to a node which should be worked on next in case a\\nwork phase gets interrupted (more on that later). For the sake of simplicity\\nyou can assume it's the parent fiber.</p>\\n<p>So the <code>Scheduler</code> goes up the tree starting from the node that the update\\nshould be scheduled for, bumping up priorities where needed along the way,\\nuntil it reaches the root. It can see that it's at the root, because there is\\nno <code>return</code> node from it.\\nIn the current case (initial render), the update has been scheduled for the\\nroot node, so we're already there.</p>\\n<p>Upon reaching the root, the <code>Scheduler</code> puts it in a <code>scheduledRoot</code> list\\n(more about this later, that's how it later finds new work to do) and finally\\nschedules the work according to given priority. In our example it's\\n<code>SynchronousPriority</code>, so it jumps to the \\\"doing work\\\" phase immediately.</p>\\n<p>That's all there is to <code>render</code>. The \\\"doing work\\\" phase is generic across all\\nthe flows, so it's described in it's own chapter. You can go there now if you\\nfeel the flow. Alternatively, you can read how Fiber arrives at this phase\\nwhen you call <code>setState</code> if you need a bit more context.</p>\\n</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p><a id=\\\"orgc07b371\\\"></a></p>\\n<h2>Changing state: it's not too exotic</h2>\\n<p>Each React component instance has an <code>updater</code>.\\nThe <code>updater</code> is an injected dependency and mediates the communication between\\nthe components and the React core.</p>\\n<p>With Fiber, the <code>updater</code> has 4 responsibilities:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Find a fiber instance in the tree that corresponds to this component.</li>\\n<li>Ask the <code>Scheduler</code> about the priority level for this fiber.</li>\\n<li>Push updates to the fiber's update queue.</li>\\n<li>Schedule update work to be done with the determined priority level.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>Sounds familiar? It should, because that's almost exactly the same thing that\\nhappens on render.</p>\\n<p>You probably know that, but I should point out that there are two forms of arguments\\nit can be called with:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><code>setState({ ... }, [callback])</code></li>\\n<li><code>setState((prevState, props) => ({ ... }), [callback])</code></li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>It's not crucial at this point, but good for you to keep in mind as the\\nfirst form will eventually become deprecated. More on that later.</p>\\n<p>Ok, so you call <code>setState((prevState, props) => ({ ... }), [callback])</code>\\nin your component. It tells its <code>updater</code> to enqueue a <code>setState</code>.</p>\\n<p>Let's go through the 4 responsibilities.</p>\\n<h3>1. Find a fiber instance in the tree that corresponds to this component.</h3>\\n<p>   It's just getting a thing from the <code>ReactInstanceMap</code> - which is just that, a\\nmap, nothing fancy. One perhaps slightly interesting thing about it is that\\nit maps from public facing instances to internal methods. Example:\\n</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><code><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">get</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">function</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>key<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">return</span> key<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>_reactInternalInstance<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<h3>2. Ask the <code>Scheduler</code> about the priority level for this fiber.</h3>\\n<p>   There is a <code>Scheduler</code> method called <code>getPriorityContext</code> that provides a\\nsuitable priority level for a fiber update. For all intents and purposes,\\nthe priority level for a <code>setState</code> will be <code>LowPriority</code>. Refer to the\\nglossary to see how that priority level stacks up against the others.</p>\\n<p>   <em>There are 2 edge cases to this, but you shouldn't concern yourself with\\nthem too much.\\nIf you're studying for a test and must know, they are:\\nexplicitly passing a <code>useSyncScheduling: true</code> parameter to the context getting\\nfunction, which will result in <code>SynchronousPriority</code>; and having\\n<code>priorityContext</code> of <code>SynchronousPriority</code> during the work phase or a\\n<code>batchedUpdates</code> callback - which will result in <code>TaskPriority</code>.</em></p>\\n<h3>3. Push updates to the fiber's update queue.</h3>\\n<p>   This logic is pretty much the same as in the initial render case. The only\\ndifferences are that:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><code>setState</code> is not a top-level update, so the code doesn't check if the\\nupdate is a top-level unmount.</li>\\n<li>the priority level is lower (<code>LowPriority</code>).</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>   The new update is being inserted to the fiber's update queue according to the\\npriority level - so most likely it will get added to the end of the queue.</p>\\n<h3>4. Schedule update work to be done with the determined priority level.</h3>\\n<p>   As I've mentioned before, this logic is generic across all the flows - so\\nnothing changes here in terms of walking the tree. To reiterate, Fiber walks\\nthe <code>return</code> nodes starting from the node for which the update is being\\nscheduled until it reaches the root node (whose <code>return</code> is <code>null</code>). Along\\nthe way, it bumps up the <code>pendingWorkPriority</code> of each node to the currently\\ngiven level if it's lower. In this case the level is <code>LowPriority</code> so it's\\nnot likely for too many changes in the <code>pendingWorkPriority</code> values to occur.</p>\\n<p>   After reaching the root, Fiber schedules the update work - due to\\n<code>LowPriority</code> it's scheduled with <code>requestIdleCallback</code>.\\nThat brings us to the end of the <code>setState</code> flow.\\nThe logic exits and when time comes, the work phase begins.</p>\\n<p><a id=\\\"org13b502a\\\"></a></p>\\n<h2>Doing the work: show me the money</h2>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Ahh, you're here. Good. We've got a problem. A big one.</p>\\n<p>– <cite>The Overseer, Vault 13</cite></p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>Well, not really. ;) Or not so much anymore at least, having asynchronous work\\nscheduling on our side!\\nThat said though, you might want to take a breath/coffee/stretch before this one - this is the\\nmeat and potatoes of Fiber and might get a bit dense.</p>\\n<p>The actual execution of the scheduled work is split up in 2 main phases:\\nrender/reconciliation and commit.</p>\\n<p>Let's jump in.</p>\\n<p><a id=\\\"orga27f81c\\\"></a></p>\\n<h3>Render / reconciliation.</h3>\\n<p>This phase happens within the fiber tree and thus can be interrupted.\\nNo DOM interaction takes place here yet. This is one of the big wins and differentiating factors from the traditional\\nrenderer.\\nAs the code can rely on the <code>deadline</code> value provided by\\n<code>requestIdleCallback</code>, it can split the work in time to avoid busting UI frames.</p>\\n<p>During this phase, Fiber aggregates the updates building up a second,\\n<code>workInProgress</code> copy of the fiber tree, which is the <code>alternate</code> of the\\n<code>current</code> tree. The <code>current</code> tree is the one that is flushed to the DOM at\\nthe given moment.</p>\\n<p>Each of the flows described previously stopped at the phase where the work\\nwas to be executed immediately (for <code>SynchronousPriority</code>) or scheduled with\\nan async callback request function.</p>\\n<p>The function that is being called or scheduled at that point is <code>performWork</code>.\\nIts purpose is to catch and handle errors happening during the reconciliation of the\\nupdates and building up the tree. It does it by running a <code>while</code> loop that\\nbails out in case of errors. Within this loop, the <code>workLoop</code> function\\nis being called.</p>\\n<p>We're here. The core of the nuclear reactor.</p>\\n<p><code>workLoop</code> finds a fiber to work on, which consists of looking through the\\n<code>scheduledRoot</code> list (that's where the top-level updates go, remember?) for\\nthe highest priority root fiber.</p>\\n<p>Then, it checks whether a <code>deadline</code> exists and whether the current priority\\nof work is lower than <code>TaskPriority</code>, meaning that the execution of this work\\nmust obey the time limitations of the current frame.\\nIf there is no <code>deadline</code> or the priority is high enough then it runs a normal\\n<code>while</code> loop until it can find no more work to do.</p>\\n<p>If a <code>deadline</code> exists however (or the priority is low), then it runs a <code>while</code>\\nloop until there is work to be done and the <code>deadline</code> hasn't yet expired.\\nAs long as that conditions hold, in terms of Fiber <strong>we are in a deferred batch</strong>.\\n(again, any bells ringing? <code>batchedUpdates</code> way back when I was describing <code>render</code>?)\\n<span class=\\\"underline\\\">This is where the decision is being made to either carry on with processing the\\nfibers or to defer the processing to the next frame to avoid causing jank in the UI.</span></p>\\n<p>Here, the current unit of work is being <em>performed</em>.\\nPerforming the work is a process consisting of two stages: <code>begin</code> and <code>complete</code>.</p>\\n<h4>Stage 1: beginning the work</h4>\\n<p>When the work is \\\"being begun\\\", the code checks whether the priority of\\nthe work-in-progress fiber is high enough to be processed given the priority at\\nwhich work is currently supposed to be processed and bails out if it's not.</p>\\n<p>Beginning the work encompasses a lot of things, which I think are out of scope\\nsince we're deep enough and they would take <strong>a lot</strong> of space to describe.\\nIn short, what happens here depends on the work-in-progress fiber type, and is\\nhandled by a big <code>switch</code> statement:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><code><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">switch</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>workInProgress<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>tag<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">case</span> IndeterminateComponent<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">return</span> <span class=\\\"token function\\\">mountIndeterminateComponent</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>\\n      current<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span>\\n      workInProgress<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span>\\n      priorityLevel<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">case</span> FunctionalComponent<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">return</span> <span class=\\\"token function\\\">updateFunctionalComponent</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>current<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> workInProgress<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">case</span> ClassComponent<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">return</span> <span class=\\\"token function\\\">updateClassComponent</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>current<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> workInProgress<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> priorityLevel<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">case</span> HostRoot<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">return</span> <span class=\\\"token function\\\">updateHostRoot</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>current<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> workInProgress<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> priorityLevel<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">case</span> HostComponent<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">return</span> <span class=\\\"token function\\\">updateHostComponent</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>current<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> workInProgress<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">case</span> HostText<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">return</span> <span class=\\\"token function\\\">updateHostText</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>current<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> workInProgress<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">case</span> CoroutineHandlerPhase<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token comment\\\">// This is a restart.
